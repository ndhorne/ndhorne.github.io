      about me and my various programming pursuits.

            Access Granted JS
          </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Can you actually crack a four-digit PIN on your first attempt
          as seen in the movies on a telltale worn keypad? The "worn"
          keys contained in the PIN have been highlighted on the keypad.
          PINs are four digits in length. Digits may be repeated
          resulting in PINs with less than four keys being highlighted.
          PINs may begin with zero. Input is accepted by way of both
          mouse primary button and keyboard number keys.

          Access Granted JS "Classified"
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This new but not necessarily improved implementation of Access
          Granted JS leverages ECMAScript 6 classes to encapsulate data
          and behaviors together inside a single self-contained unit
          more often referred to as an instance in a bid to manage
          complexity through the constructs afforded by object oriented
          programming.

          Access Granted JS Prototypal
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This new but not necessarily improved implementation of Access
          Granted JS utilizes constructor functions and prototypal
          inheritance to logically encapsulate related data and behavior
          together inside of a single self-contained unit more commonly
          known as an instance in a bid to manage complexity through the
          constructs afforded by object oriented programming.
