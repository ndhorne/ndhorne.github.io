Congo Skulls

A pointless diversion by Nicholas D. Horne

A remake of Toggle Booleans' 1993 Windows 3.1 freeware classic Amazon Skulls in JavaScript with some new features/amenities including local multiplayer, custom grid size, keyboard controls, and undo (ctrl+z). Each piece played (with the exception of the first piece) must border the last piece played and border that piece only. The first player to play a piece bordering more than one piece (the last piece) loses the game. Make the last valid move to win!
