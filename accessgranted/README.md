Crack a PIN knowing the digits that the PIN comprises

Can you actually crack a four-digit PIN on your first attempt as seen in the movies on a telltale worn keypad? The "worn" keys contained in the PIN have been highlighted on the keypad. PINs are four digits in length. Digits may be repeated resulting in PINs with less than four keys being highlighted. PINs may begin with zero. Input is accepted by way of both mouse primary button and keyboard number keys.
